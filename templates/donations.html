<h1>SuttaCentral Donations</h1>
<p>Your donation is greatly appreciated, and will support the ongoing development and improvement of SuttaCentral. We want to continue bring the Buddha’s word to people all around the world.</p>

<p class="donate"><span class="donate-button">Give Now</span></p>

<p>SuttaCentral Development Trust Account is open with Adelaide Bendigo community sector banking, which has ethical and environmentally-friendly investment policies.</p>

<p>Details are as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>Account name: SuttaCentral Development Trust</li>
<li>Bank name: Adelaide Bendigo Community Sector Banking</li>
<li>BSB: 633 000 </li>
<li>Account no: 154500086</li>
<li>Address: 273, Pacific Highway, Turramurra NSW 2074</li>
<li>Swift code: BENDAU3B </li>
</ul>

<h2>A professional, full-time developer</h2>

<p>The content on SuttaCentral has been made possible by volunteers. While their contribution is irreplaceable, we believe that these teachings are of such significance, and the work involved so great, that it is time for us to employ a full time developer. </p>

<p>We are fortunate to have the services of Blake Walsh, one of the few people in the world who is qualified in the Buddhist texts and languages, and also in progamming. With your support, Blake will be able to work full time to make SuttaCentral even better.</p>

<p>Our target is to raise $1000/week to continue to employ Blake, and support the other costs of SuttaCentral.</p>

<h2>How can I help?</h2>

<p>Contact our volunteer financial manager, Deepika Weerakoon (meditateasy@gmail.com), to make a donation. Deepika manages the funds on behalf of SuttaCentral Development Trust. Consider making a weekly or monthly donation, to help us pay the regular wages. </p>

<p>For donors of over $100, we would like to offer as a gift a printed copy of the Theragāthā, the “Verses of the Senior Monks”. This fascinating but little-known text from the Pali Canon has been freshly translated by Bhante Sujato for SuttaCentral.</p>
