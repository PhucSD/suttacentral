<li><h2>ASCII Punctuation to Unicode</h2></li>
<li><p>
This utility will convert ascii punctuation into typographically correct
unicode equivalents. At present it only understands English punctuation conventions. However even for other languages it may be useful since the
English punctuation marks can be trivially search-replaced with those of
the other language.

<p>While it is primarily designed to convert ascii to unicode, it will also fix
mistakes with unicode punctuation, these might arise, for example, from OCR
or typos.

<p>If the document uses punctuation in unusual ways then results may be poor. It is designed for literature, not scientific or scholarly documents.

<p>Please put all the files you want processed in a zip archive and upload the zip file. Only zip archives are supported. You will receive a zip archive in return.</p>
