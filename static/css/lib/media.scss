//	IMPORTANT:  The usage of these $breakpoints should be 'mobile first', meaning that if a new page is deisgned,
//				Make it look good on the smallest screen possible, then increase the width until the design looks
//				bad and then add or adjust the $breakpoint variables below.  Terms like "mobile" and "tablet" are not
//				used (but still defined for legacy purposes) since it is the screen size that matters and 
//              devices will be changing in the future.


//  These are the standard breakpoints used within the $breakpointNames definition below
$small-width:   480px;
$med-width:     908px;
$large-width:   1200px;

//  These are breakpoints that fall between the standard breakpoints above
$header-small-width:     550px;
$header-large-width:     800px;
