These javascript files are used for the lookup dictionaries. They are automatically generated subsets of much larger source documents.

These files are not JSON mainly because plain scripts work with both the online and offline builds, unlike JSON/JSONp. This can be worked around in Chrome by setting it to treat 'file://' as always same domain, but not working by default, is not desirable.
