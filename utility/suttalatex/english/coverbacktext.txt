The Theragāthā, or “Verses of the Senior Monks”, is a collection of inspired sayings associated with monks who lived in the time of the Buddha, or occasionally a little later. It is the companion to the Therīgāthā, which contains verses of the nuns.
\quad These verses cover a wide range of topics, but most characteristically they express the joy of a life of meditation and seclusion in the forest. In these verses we hear the voices of many monks and nuns who are otherwise unknown to us, and whose voices are preserved here alone.
This new translation of the Theragāthā by Bhikkhu Sujato was prepared specially for SuttaCentral.
