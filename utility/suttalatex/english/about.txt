SuttaCentral gathers together the texts from the early period of Buddhism, shows the connections between them, and makes them available in original languages and modern translations. These texts are the most reliable guide to the teachings of the historical Buddha, and form the foundations of all Buddhist traditions.

At https://suttacentral.net we provide over 50,000 texts in over 30 languages, and at https://discourse.suttacentral.net we host essays, discussions, and information regarding these texts. In addition, we make selected texts available in printed editions.

SuttaCentral is a non-profit charity, whose purpose is to make the teachings of the Buddha available to people all around the world. If you would like to support our work, you can donate at https://suttacentral.net/donations.
